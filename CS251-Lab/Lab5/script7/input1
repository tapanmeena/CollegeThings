We are the sum of experiences that we encounter as we go through life. 
Day to day struggles and triumphs are experienced by all of the world's creatures. 
As human beings, when we encounter a challenge, we have freedom to choose how to react. 
Every decision that we make leads us down a different road. We will never come to exactly the same crossroads. 
Every decision that we make has significance. The tiniest choice that we make reverberates throughout the entire universe.
I sleep in the clouds, dream in the sky,
I'll keep dreaming as life passes me by,
I think my dreams keep me sane,
I dream of happiness, a life without pain,
some people say I'm stuck in this place,
and I'll never go anywhere,
but in my dreams I've already been there,
I know some day I'll have to wake up,
but I feel the real world is more like a nightmare,
I'm safe in my closed eye wonderland,
this poem goes to all the dreamers that understand,
no matter what they say...
keep your dreams but don't dream your life away,
